# Introduction #
Source control was started on this project 11/19. This template was based off the wordpress theme blankslate; it's my first time trying to customize a wordpress site. Prior to source control I had been working for 2 or 3 weeks on this on and off. The main things I changed were the footer; I imported the current homepage and physics page from my old schs-site repo [here](http://code.google.com/p/schs-site) and pasted them as pages. I also added the gallery with the APOD from NASA. There's many more things I am forgetting, but I'll write them down here if I recall them.
